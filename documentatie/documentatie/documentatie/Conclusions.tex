\chapter{Discussion and conclusions}

Based on the experimental results , we can affirm that a significant number of structural dependencies are also logical \cite{ct10}, \cite{ct9}.The number of overlaps between structural and logical dependencies is influenced by the rules of extracting logical dependencies. In average, if we choose to take into consideration all commits without setting a threshold for the number of files changed we obtain an overlap of structural and logical dependencies of 71\% which is with 47\% more than if we take into consideration only commits with less then 5 source code files changed per commit (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). \\ It can be observed that at extremities we have systems ID 5,6 with an overlap only 2\% and system ID 2 with an overlap of 100\%. However this systems are very small, but the other systems, that have more commits and more classes, have close rates of overlapping.

Table \ref{table:7} illustrates the percentage rates for all the categories mentioned in Subsection 2.2 and in addition a last category that takes all commits regardless of the number of changed files. How it can be seen, the overlapping rates are also influenced by the comments considerations . The rates are with aprox 6\% lower if comments are not taken into consideration as a change.

  \begin{tabular}{@{}c||cc@{}}
    \toprule
       Category & With comments & Without comments  \\
    \midrule
less 5	&	24.33\% &	17,4\%	\\
more 5 less 20	&	36.26\% &	32,81\%\\
more 20	&	35.33\%	&	34,89\%\\
total & 71,47\% & 64.9\% \\
    \bottomrule

As a conclusion, it results large number of structural dependencies are not doubled by logical which can indicate that the systems are stable. It also result that taken or not comments as change, the final results are not influenced in a big percentage. What influences the result of the overlaping between logical and structural dependencies is the number of files taken into consideration .
